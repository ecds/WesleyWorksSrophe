								<h2> <i class="fas fa-landmark"></i> A Short History of The Wesley Works Editorial Project</h2>
							</header>
							<p>A fully critical presentation of John Wesley’s writings had long been a desideratum in order to furnish documentary sources illustrating his contribution to both catholic and evangelical Christianity. Several scholars—notably Professor Albert C. Outler, Professor Franz Hildebrandt, Dean Merrimon Cuninggim, and Dean Robert E. Cushman—discussed the possibility of such an edition. Under the leadership of Dean Cushman, a board of directors was formed in 1960 comprising the deans of four sponsoring theological schools in Methodist-related universities in the United States: Drew, Duke, Emory, and Southern Methodist. They appointed an Editorial Committee to formulate plans, and enlisted an international and interdenominational team of scholars for the Wesley Works Editorial Project.</p>

							<p>The works were divided into units of cognate material, with a separate editor (or joint editors) responsible for each unit. Dr. Frank Baker was appointed textual editor for the whole project, with responsibility for supplying each unit editor with a critically developed, accurate Wesley text. The text seeks to represent Wesley’s thought in its fullest and most deliberate expression, in so far as this can be determined from the available evidence. Substantive variant readings in any British edition published during Wesley’s lifetime are shown in appendices to the units, preceded by a summary of the problems faced and the solutions reached in the complex task of securing and presenting Wesley’s text. The aim throughout is to enable Wesley to be read with maximum ease and understanding, and with minimal intrusion by the editors.</p>

							<p>John Wesley PreachingThis edition includes all Wesley’s original or mainly original prose works, together with one volume devoted to his Collection of Hymns (1780) and another to his extensive work as editor and publisher of extracts from the writings of others. An essential feature of the project is a bibliography outlining the historical settings of the works published by Wesley and his brother Charles, sometimes jointly, sometimes separately. The bibliography also offers analytical data for identifying each of the two thousand editions of these 450 items that were published during the lifetime of John Wesley. An index is supplied for each unit and a general index for the whole edition.</p>

							<p>The Delegates of the Oxford University Press agreed to undertake publication of this new edition of Wesley’s works, but announced in June 1982 that due to severe economic problems they were regretfully compelled to withdraw from the enterprise with the completion in 1983 of volume 7, the Collection of Hymns. Abingdon Press offered its services, beginning with the publication of the first volume of the Sermons in 1984, the bicentennial year of the formation of American Methodism as an autonomous church. The new title assumed (The Bicentennial Edition of the Works of John Wesley), however, refers more broadly to the bicentennial of Wesley’s total activities as author, editor, and publisher, from 1733 to 1791, especially as summarized in the first edition of his collected works in thirty-two volumes, 1771–74.

							<p><img class="preaching" src="images/john-wesley-preaching.jpeg" align="left" /> <p id="cont2">Dean Robert E. Cushman of Duke University undertook general administration and promotion of the project until 1971, when he was succeeded as president by Dean Joseph D. Quillian, Jr., of Southern Methodist University, these two universities having furnished the major support and guidance for the enterprise. During the decade 1961–70, the Editorial Committee supervised the task of setting editorial principles and procedures, and general editorship was shared by Dr. Eric W. Baker, Dean William R. Cannon, and Dean Cushman. In 1969 the directors appointed Dr. Frank Baker, early attached to the project as bibliographer and textual editor for Wesley’s text, as editor-in-chief also. Upon Dean Quillian’s retirement in 1981, he was succeeded as president of the project by Dean James E. Kirby, Jr., also of Southern Methodist University. In 1986 the directors appointed Richard P. Heitzenrater as general editor to begin the chief editorship of the project with the Journal and Diaries unit, with Dr. Baker continuing as textual editor. Dean Dennis M. Campbell of Duke University was elected president of the project in 1990. Dean Russell E. Richey of Emory University succeeded Dr. Campbell in 2003. At that same point the directors named Randy L. Maddox as associate general editor, to work alongside Dr. Heitzenrater in completing the project. Dean William B. Lawrence of Southern Methodist University assumed the role of president in 2006. And most recently Randy L. Maddox stepped into the role of General Editor, upon Dr. Heitzenrater’s retirement from that capacity.

							</p>
							<p>Other sponsoring bodies have been successively added to the original four: Boston University School of Theology, The General Commission on Archives and History of The United Methodist Church, The United Methodist Board of Higher Education and Ministry, and the World Methodist Council. For the continuing support of the sponsoring institutions the Directors express their profound thanks. They gratefully acknowledge also the encouragement and financial support that have come from the Historical Societies and Commissions on Archives and History of many Annual Conferences, as well as the donations of private individuals and foundations.</p>

							<p>On June 9, 1976, The Wesley Works Editorial Project was incorporated in the state of North Carolina as a nonprofit corporation. In 1977 by-laws were approved governing the appointment and duties of the directors, their officers, and their Executive Committee.</p>

										<li class="li1"><a target="_new" href="https://www.abingdonpress.com/product/9780687462100">Volume 1:  <i>Sermons I</i> (1–33)</a><br />This is the first in an eagerly awaited series of four volumes of John Wesley’s sermons. It contains a detailed introduction as well as sermons 1-33 of Sermons on Several Occasions.</li>
										<li class="li1"><a target="_new" href="https://www.abingdonpress.com/product/9780687462117">Volume 2:  <i>Sermons II</i> (34–70)</a><br />This is the second in an eagerly awaited series of four volumes of John Wesley’s sermons. This volume contains sermons 34-70 from Sermons on Several Occasions.</li>
										<li class="li1"><a target="_new" href="https://www.abingdonpress.com/product/9780687462124">Volume 3:  <i>Sermons III</i> (71–114)</a><br />This is the third in an eagerly awaited series of four volumes of John Wesley’s sermons. This volume contains sermons 71-114 from Sermons on Several Occasions, as well as 6 additional sermons.</li>
										<li class="li1"><a target="_new" href="https://www.abingdonpress.com/product/9780687462131">Volume 4:  <i>Sermons IV</i> (115–51)</a><br />This is the fourth in an eagerly awaited series of four volumes of John Wesley’s sermons. This volume contains 18 sermons that were published in the <i>Arminian Magazine </i>from 1789 to 1792.  It also contains 19 sermons that were taken from Wesley’s manuscripts.</li>
										<li class="li1"><a target="_new" href="https://www.abingdonpress.com/product/9780687462186">Volume 7:  <i>A Collection of Hymns for the Use of the People called Methodists</i></a><br />A Collection of Hymns for the Use of the People Called Methodist, first published in 1780, was the definitive collection of hymns to appear during the lifetime of John Wesley. As the culmination of a lengthy process of preparing a ‘general hymn-book,’ he selected the 525 hymns presented here from more than fifty hymnbooks published during the preceding forty-three years. It was very distinctly Methodist in character. The arrangement of the hymns was carefully designed to reflect the Wesleyan concept of the way of salvation and the pattern of Christian experience.</li>
										<li class="li1"><a target="_new" href="https://www.abingdonpress.com/product/9780687462148">Volume 9:  <i>The Methodist Societies: History, Nature, and Design</i></a><br />Two volumes of this edition of <i>The Works of John Wesley </i>present writings that describe and illumine the purpose and practice of the Methodist Societies, the particular ecclesiastical form in and through which Wesley’s work and thought were embodied. The present volume deals with the history, nature, and design of the Societies.  This collection of material, though somewhat miscellaneous in nature, helps to recreate for the modern reader some sense of the goals of Wesley’s Societies, as well as the structure and practices through which those goals were to be attained</li>
										<li class="li1"><a target="_new" href="https://www.abingdonpress.com/product/9781426711909">Volume 10: <i>The Methodist Societies, The Minutes of Conference</i></a><br />This second volume focused on the Methodist Societies reproduces the Minutes as a formal record and conveys the nature and role of the Conference in Methodist life and polity during John Wesley’s time. Included is information from letters and diaries of preachers as well as from John Wesley, some of which is newly published here. This material highlights some of the problems that arose in the meetings themselves, which in Wesley’s eyes was merely summoned to advise him but, in his later years, almost imperceptibly became more of a legislative and ruling body, increasingly preoccupied with what would happen after Wesley&#8217;s death. Despite the breadth of this volume, the American Minutes are not included, partly because they were in no sense Wesley’s own work and partly because they could not be, at present, edited to the required standard. The Irish Minutes are included in an appendix.</li>
										<li class="li1"><a target="_new" href="https://www.abingdonpress.com/product/9780687462155">Volume 11: <i>The Appeals to Men of Reason and Religion and Certain Related Open Letters</i></a><br />This volume, containing The Appeals to Men of Reason and Religion, is the first to be published. The aim of Wesley’s Appeals was to correct current misconceptions of his movement. In the course of refuting attacks upon himself, Wesley also presented a positive statement of his theological and ecclesiastical position. Yet the attacks continued. This volume contains also his open letters replying to Edmund Gibson, Bishop of Exeter, and to William Warburton, Bishop of Gloucester.</li>
										<li class="li1"><a target="_new" href="https://www.abingdonpress.com/product/9781426744303"><span class="s2">Volume 12: <em>Doctrinal and Controversial Treatises I</em></span></a><br />The first of three theological volumes, this volume is devoted to four of John Wesley’s foundational treatises on soteriology. These treatises include, first, Wesley’s extract from the <i>Homilies </i>of the Church of England, which he published to convince his fellow Anglican clergy that the ‘evangelical’ emphasis on believers experiencing a conscious assurance of God’s pardoning love was consistent with this standard of Anglican doctrine. Next comes Wesley’s extract of Richard Baxter’s<i>Aphorisms of Justification</i>, aimed more at those who shared his evangelical emphasis, invoking this honored moderate Puritan to challenge antinomian conceptions of the doctrine of justification by faith. This is followed by Wesley’s abridgement of the <i>Shorter Catechism</i> issued by the Westminster Assembly in his<i>Christian Library</i>, where he affirms broad areas of agreement with this standard of Reformed doctrine—while quietly removing items with which he disagreed. The fourth item is Wesley’s extended response to the Dissenter John Taylor on the doctrine of original sin, which highlights differences within the broad ‘Arminian’ camp, with Wesley resisting a drift toward naively optimistic views of human nature that he discerned in Taylor.</li>
										<li class="li1"><a target="_new" href="https://www.abingdonpress.com/product/9781426766978">Volume 13: <i>Doctrinal and Controversial Treatises II</i></a><br />The second of three volumes devoted to Wesley’s theological writings contains two major sets of material. The first set (edited by Paul Wesley Chilcote) contains writings throughout Wesley’s ministry devoted to defense of the doctrine of Christian perfection, including “A Plain Account of Christian Perfection.” The second set (edited by Kenneth J. Collins) collects Wesley’s various treatises focused on predestination and related issues, often in direct debate with Calvinist writers, including “Predestination Calmly Considered.”</li>
										<li class="li1"><a target="_new" href="https://www.abingdonpress.com/product/9780687462216">Volume 18:  <i>Journals and Diaries I</i> (1735–1738)</a><br />The Introduction to this edition discusses the nature of Wesley&#8217;s Journal, places it in the context of autobiography as a genre, examines its construction, and discusses Wesley&#8217;s frame of mind during its writings. One of the major functions of this scholarly edition is to reveal John Wesley &#8220;in the light of his involvement in the crowded forum of eighteenth century theological debate.&#8221; Wesley&#8217;s writings are saturated with references to Scripture, the Latin and Greek classics, the early Church Fathers, his theological predecessors, English poets and playwrights, and those &#8220;natural philosophers&#8221; exploring the wonder of God in creation.</li>
										<li class="li1"><a target="_new" href="https://www.abingdonpress.com/product/9780687462223">Volume 19:  <i>Journal and Diaries II</i> (1738–1743)</a><br />This is the second volume of Wesley’s Journal to appear in the critical edition of The Works of John Wesley. Covering the period from late 1783 to 1743, it documents — in Wesley’s own words — the formative years of the Methodist revival in Great Britain. Previously unpublished material from Wesley’s private diaries supplements the account in the published Journal of such key events as Wesley’s first adventure in ”field preaching,” the growing breach between Wesley and the Moravians, the formation of the first Methodist Societies, the establishment of the New Room in Bristol and the Foundery in London, and the emergence of the ”lay preachers” or ”circuit riders.”</li>
										<li class="li1"><a target="_new" href="https://www.abingdonpress.com/product/9780687462230">Volume 20:  <i>Journal and Diaries III</i> (1743–1754)</a><br />This is the third volume of Wesley’s Journal to appear in the critical edition of The Works of John Wesley. Covering the period from late 1743 through 1754, it contains four ”Extracts” from Wesley’s Journal (6-9) which document, in Wesley’s own words, an important period of expansion and organization in the Wesleyan revival. He describes in vivid detail the spread of the Methodist movement in the north and west of England, as well as its beginnings in Ireland and Scotland. This period of growing social and political tension is marked also by Wesley’s theological controversies with leading figures in the Established Church and his physical confrontations with riotous mobs in the countryside. His yearly schedule included extensive travel to visit the societies, and held the first conferences of Methodist preachers in England and Ireland to settle important matters of doctrine and discipline. He produced several key writings during that time, including three volumes of Sermons and two volumes of Explanatory Notes upon the New Testament. His writings in medicine were matched by the opening of a free public dispensary, and he continued to develop other social programs in education, child care, and finance for the poor. Features footnotes to quotations, key themes, and background information.</li>
										<li class="li1"><a target="_new" href="https://www.abingdonpress.com/product/9780687462254">Volume 21:  <i>Journal and Diaries IV</i> (1755–1765)</a><br />This is the fourth volume of Wesley’s Journal to appear in the critical edition of The Works of John Wesley. Covering the decade from early 1755 to the middle of 1765, it contains four “Extracts” from Wesley’s Journal (10-13) that document — in Wesley’s own words — a significant period of consolidation in the Wesleyan revival. He describes in vivid detail the growth of the Methodist movement, especially in the central portions of northern England as well as the spread into Ireland and Scotland.</li>
										<li class="li1"><a target="_new" href="https://www.abingdonpress.com/product/9780687462261">Volume 22:  <i>Journal and Diaries V</i> (1765–1775)</a><br />This is the fifth volume of Wesley’s Journal to appear in the critical edition of The Work of John Wesley. Covering the decade from mid-1765 to the beginning of 1776, it contains four ”Extracts” of Wesley’s Journal (14-17) that document — in Wesley’s own words — a significant period of growth and controversy in the Methodist movement. He describes in some detail the continuing spread of the revival into the farther reaches of the British Isles, the points of contention that threaten to disrupt the progress of the revival, his widening involvement in social issues such as the slave trade, the various attempts at union with the Church of England, and the spread of the Wesleyan movement to the American colonies.</li>
										<li class="li1"><a target="_new" href="https://www.abingdonpress.com/product/9780687462278">Volume 23:  <i>Journal and Diaries VI</i> (1776–1786)</a><br />This is the sixth volume of Wesley’s Journal to appear in the critical edition of The Works of John Wesley. Covering the decade from 1776 to the end of 1786, it contains three full ”Extracts” of Wesley’s Journal (18-20) and the beginning of his last (21). These materials describe — in Wesley’s own words — a crucial period that helps define the shape of Methodist theology and organization. The issues surrounding the manner of John Wesley’s leadership and the authority of the Conference within Methodism furnish the framework for this period. Wesley begins working with new leaders such as Thomas Coke and Francis Asbury and makes several crucial decisions regarding Methodism in America, including the matter of ordination. He also faces several continuing points of contention in Great Britain that threaten to disrupt the progress of the revival, such as the problems associated with the building of preaching houses and ”fixing” them on the Methodist plan. At the same time, he describes examples of strong local revivals that continue to appear throughout the connection and he fulfills his plans for a new chapel on City Road in London. Several crucial events in 1784 define the continuing nature of Methodist organization, especially the legal establishment of the Conference.</li>
										<li class="li1"><a target="_new" href="https://www.abingdonpress.com/product/9780687033492">Volume 24:  <i>Journal and Diaries VII</i> (1787–1791)</a><br />Volume 24 concludes John Wesley’s Journal and Diaries and includes a complete index to the seven volumes of the series which cover Wesley’s Journal and Diaries.</li>
										<li class="li1"><a target="_new" href="https://www.abingdonpress.com/product/9780687462162">Volume 25:  <i>Letters I</i> (1721–1739)</a><br />Although many of the letters of John Wesley are of value as literature — especially as crisp statements of his views or desires with little attempt at embellishment — their major importance is as a revelation of him as a man and of the people and events of his day, especially those linked with the Methodist movement. They furnish us, in fact, with a portrait through seventy years that is both more revealing in detail and fuller in coverage than any other source.</li>
										<li class="li1"><a target="_new" href="https://www.abingdonpress.com/product/9780687462179">Volume 26:  <i>Letters II</i> (1740–1755)</a><br />The second volume of letters in The Works of John Wesley, this text spans the years 1740-1755.</li>
										<li class="li1"><a target="_new" href="https://www.abingdonpress.com/product/9781501806223">Volume 27: <em>Letters III</em> (1756–1765)</a><br />The correspondence in this volume illuminates critical developments in the Wesleyan movement between 1756 and 1765, including very significant rifts between John Wesley and his brother Charles and between John Wesley and his wife Mary, Wesley’s attempts to deal with radical enthusiasts and separatists (such as Thomas Maxfield) within the Methodist movement, his relationship to Greek Orthodox leader Gerasimos (Erasmus) Avlonites, and Wesley’s activities related to the Seven Years War.</li>
										<li class="li1"><a target="_new" href="https://www.abingdonpress.com/product/9781501859014">Volume 32: <em>Medical and Health Writings</em></a><br />This volume collects all of John Wesley’s writings related to health and wellness. These range from his best-selling home guide to health care, Primitive Physic, to his interest in electrical shock therapy, to his concern for nervous disorders. The volume will be of keen interest to all who are committed to recovering Wesley’s holistic understanding of salvation and ministry in the present church, as well as those seeking a better understanding of medical care in the eighteenth century.</li>

												<h2><i class="fas fa-link"></i> Online Resources</h2>
											</header>
											<div class="entry entry-content">
												<p></p>
												A primary purpose of this website is to provide additional resources for study of the writings of John Wesley. These resources fall into three major categories.</p>
												<p><strong>Additional Works by Wesley as Editor</strong></p>
												<p>In the early planning of The Wesley Works Project it became clear that there was not room to include all of John Wesley’s manuscript materials and publications, particularly given the number of printed works by other writers that he abridged and republished. It was decided to devote the printed volumes of <em>The Bicentennial Edition</em> mainly to prose items that were largely original to Wesley. While understandable, much can be gained from studying not only Wesley’s selection of materials by others to republish, but also his editorial practices in abridging them. Thus one section of this site will be devoted to transcriptions, with essential annotation, of Wesley’s edited publications that are not included in the printed volumes. Major groupings planned include the following:</p>
												<ul>
												<li>The <em>Arminian Magazine</em></li>
												<li>The <em>Christian Library</em>
												<ul>
												<li style="list-style-type:circle;">Abridgement of Jonathan Edwards&#8217;s <a href="https://wesleyworks.files.wordpress.com/2020/03/edwards-on-religious-affections.pdf"><em>Treatise Concerning Religious Affections</em></a> (pdf)</li>
												</ul>
												</li>
												<li>Poetry and Hymn Collections: <em>The Bicentennial Edition</em> includes (vol. 7) a critical edition of John Wesley’s magisterial <em>Collection of Hymns for the Use of the People Called Methodist</em> (1780). Through the agency of the Center for Studies in the Wesleyan Tradition at Duke Divinity School there is now access to transcriptions of&nbsp;<a href="http://divinity.duke.edu/initiatives-centers/cswt/wesley-texts/poetry-hymn">John Wesley’s other edited poetry and hymn collections</a> (as well as a full set of Charles Wesley’s verse).</li>
												<li><em>Survey of the Wisdom of God in Creation</em></li>
												<li>Other edited works</li>
												</ul>
												<p><strong>Background Texts</strong></p>
												<p>It is essential to study Wesley’s manuscript and published writings within their larger context, including correspondence that he received and published items critical of him or the Methodist movement. Many of these background texts are readily available to scholars, but some are quite rare, including many manuscript items. A second section of this site will focus on transcriptions of the most important background material. The first major set is:</p>
												<ul>
												<li><a title="John Wesley’s In-Correspondence" href="https://wesleyworks.wordpress.com/john-wesleys-in-correspondence/">John Wesley’s In-Correspondence</a></li>
												<li><a title="jw-ms-prayer-manual" href="https://wesleyworks.files.wordpress.com/2018/03/jw-ms-prayer-manual.pdf">John Wesley’s Manuscript Prayer Manual (c. 1730–1734)</a> (pdf)</li>
												</ul>
												<p><strong>Research Aids</strong></p>
												<p>A third section of this site is dedicated to databases, bibliographies, and the like that are created as part of the work in preparing <em>The Bicentennial Edition</em> but are not planned for inclusion in the printed volumes. The initial resources include:</p>
												<ul>
												<li>Baker’s <a href="https://wesleyworks.files.wordpress.com/2019/05/baker-union-catalogue.pdf">Union Catalogue of the Publications of John and Charles Wesley (2nd edn., 1991)</a>&nbsp;(pdf)<br />
												The <em>Bicentennial Edition of the Works of John Wesley</em> includes more items than any previous edition, and utilizes a new numbering of each of the items published by John and Charles Wesley. This full list will become available in vols. 34–35, but scholars may want access to the working list. Frank Baker published an initial working list in 1966, and an expanded version in 1991. Since this published list is rare, we provide a pdf scan. Please note carefully the two portions of the volume, and that the numbering now used in the Bicentennial Edition is that at the front, as revised in 1991.</li>
												<li><a href="https://wesleyworks.wordpress.com/bibliographic-aids-on-john-wesleys-library/">Bibliographic Aids on John Wesley’s Library and Works He Read</a></li>
												<li><a title="bios-recurrent-persons" href="https://wesleyworks.files.wordpress.com/2021/01/bios-recurrent-persons.pdf">Biographical Guide for John Wesley’s Correspondence – Recurrent Persons</a> (pdf)<br />
												A collection of short biographies, for quick reference, of contemporary persons who appear repeatedly in John Wesley’s correspondence—whether as authors, recipients, or just mentioned in letters.</li>
												<li><a title="comprehensive-person-list" href="https://wesleyworks.files.wordpress.com/2021/01/comprehensive-person-list.pdf">Comprehensive List of Persons</a> (pdf)<br />
												A list of all persons that appear in John Wesley’s letters or in-correspondence. The list is confined to contemporary persons (not ancient authors cited), and to where more than just first and last initials are known. If a biography of the person is included in the recurrent person file, this is indicated. Otherwise, the first appearance of the person is noted, as that is where one can find whatever biographical information is known. This list covers only volumes published and transcriptions posted to date. It will be updated with each new volume.</li>
												<li><a href="https://wesleyworks.wordpress.com/cumulative-lists-of-john-wesleys-letters/">Cumulative Lists of John Wesley’s Letters</a></li>
												<li><a title="Register of John Wesley’s Preaching Texts" href="https://wesleyworks.wordpress.com/sermon-register/">John Wesley’s Sermon Register</a></li>
												<li><a title="jw-sermon-lists" href="https://wesleyworks.files.wordpress.com/2017/05/201705jw-sermon-lists.pdf">John Wesley’s Sermons – Comparative List of Collections</a>&nbsp;(pdf)<br />
												This list, compiled by Greg Van Buskirk, gives the comparative location of Wesley’s sermons in the Bicentennial Edition, Edward H. Sugden’s edition, and Thomas Jackson’s edition.</li>
